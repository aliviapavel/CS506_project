# **Automated Adipocyte Cell Identifier and Annotator** #

## Description
### Cell Type Annotator
#### Heirarchical Annotation
### Identification of Unknown/New cell types and pathways
## Goals
The goal of this project is to create an automated adipocyte cell annotator that identifies ideal cluster resolution and annotates clusters. Along with assigning celltypes based on known markers, this annotator will identify unknown or new celltypes for user review to help aid in the identification of potential new cell types and/or pathways.
## Data Collection
I plan to a utilize public data sets from the National Library of Medicine - National Center for Biotechnology Information (NLM-NCBI) genomics data repository, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/?term=adipose]. There are over 75,000 public datasets containing adipose tissue sequencing. I will then select a subset of these to use as my testing/training sets. While I do not have a specific benchmark for the number of datasets I plan to include in my project dataset, I want to ensure thorough coverage of adipocyte types (white, brown, and beige), species (human and mice), and adipocyte cell suptypes; a complete dataset for this project will include multiple examples of both species and all adipocyte types and subtypes.
## Data Visualization
The overall clustering and type annotation will be visualized with a t-SNE plot, however a
