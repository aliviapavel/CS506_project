# CS506_project
Automated Adipocyte Cell Identifier and Annotator

# Description
# Goal
# Data Collection
I plan to a utilize public data sets from the National Library of Medicine - National Center for Biotechnology Information (NLM-NCBI) genomics data repository, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/?term=adipose]. There are over 75,000 public datasets containing adipose tissue sequencing. I will then select a subset of these to use as my testing/training sets. While I do not have a specific benchmark for the number of datasets I plan to include in my project dataset, I want to ensure thorough coverage of adipocyte types (white, brown, and beige), species (human and mice), and adipocyte cell suptypes; a complete dataset for this project will include multiple examples of both species and all adipocyte types and subtypes.
